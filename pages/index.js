        <h1>NEW WARREN'S RESTRUANT IN SPACE</h1>
        <p>The famously deadly food chain Warren's has decided to launch a restruant in the most unexpected location imaginable: space. They usually have their locations in either Utah or Ohio, which makes this decision extremely surprising.</p>
        <p>
          The new location has launched with an exclusive meal: the 40 Cent Special. It's the exact same as the 30 Cent Special, except they added 10 more cents to both the price and the plate. Many customers call this <q>a dissapointment to Warren's as a whole</q> because of the similaritiy to the 30 Cent Special. A few days after the announcement, a statement was made from Warren's adressing the 40 Cent Special. Here's an excerpt from their statement:
          <br />
          <br />
          <q>
            We believe that at Warren's, anything can happen, which we mean in the most literal way we possibly can. That is why we decided to make the 40 Cent Special; after all, it would be completely unexpected for us, which is what we at Warren's strive to do. We also try to strive to make food that kills you, but we haven't been up on that, and for that we apologize. We will try to do better on that department of Warren's.
          </q>
          <br />
          <br />
          There were mixed opinions on this statement. Some believe Warren's managed to pull out their biggest trick yet with this, others believe that Warren's priorities should be in making the food more unique than unexpected. Either way, one thing's for sure: they're still going to get customers in space, despite the little amount of people there.
        </p>
        <small>Wow, that was a much better ending than last article. I should try and work on these endings more, they're kinda important.</small>

      <h1>NOTICE</h1>
      <p>
          This site doesn't work well on touchscreen devices! You can try to use
          it, just know that it'll be very broken with features like dragging
          windows and I am still working on proper touchscreen compatability.
          Feel free to close this window if you think you'll still be able to
          use it.
